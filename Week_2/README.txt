Please download all the excel files (*.xls, *.xlsx, *.csv) into the same folder with the *.ipynbs.
For Week 2's *.ipynbs, you need to copy "CRSP_daily500.csv" from the Week 1 folder in Blackboard into the same folder too.
All the *.ipynbs rename "CRSP_daily500.csv" as "CRSP_daily.csv".
If you find it necessary to understand more about the functions Prof defined, read comments following order of week2 notebook2, notebook1, notebook3, notebook4. Hope these comments will help you.
